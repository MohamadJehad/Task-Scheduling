## 3. Conclusions

### 3.1 Key Findings

1. **Brute Force guarantees optimal solutions** but is only feasible for small instances (e.g., ≤ 10 tasks)
2. **Eligibility-aware LPT provides 2-approximation guarantee** and performs excellently in practice
3. **Approximation algorithm scales efficiently** to large datasets
4. **Practical performance exceeds theoretical worst-case bounds** - achieving 1.073x ratio vs. theoretical 2x bound

### 3.2 Performance Metrics

- **Average Approximation Ratio:** 1.073x (for feasible comparisons)
- **Best Ratio:** 1.073x
- **Execution Time:** Approximation runs in ≤ 3 ms for all tested instances

### 3.3 Scalability Analysis

The brute force algorithm's computational complexity grows exponentially with the number of tasks and their eligibility sets. For the medium dataset, checking all 18 trillion combinations would be computationally infeasible. In contrast, the approximation algorithm maintains near-constant execution time across all instance sizes.

### 3.4 Practical Implications

The Eligibility-aware LPT algorithm is recommended for:
- Large-scale scheduling problems (> 10 tasks)
- Real-time scheduling systems
- Systems requiring fast solution times
- Scenarios where near-optimal solutions are acceptable

The Brute Force algorithm is recommended for:
- Small instances (≤ 10 tasks)
- Scenarios requiring guaranteed optimality
- Benchmarking and validation of approximation algorithms

## 4. Recommendations for Further Research

1. Investigate local search improvements to the approximation algorithm
2. Explore LP-based approximation techniques for better theoretical guarantees
3. Develop hybrid approaches combining brute force with approximation for medium-sized instances
4. Analyze performance on different problem instance types (e.g., worst-case, balanced, constrained)
